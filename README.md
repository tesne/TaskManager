# TaskManager
TaskManager, this webapp is a task manager (like trello, but simplier) I´ve made to practice with ReacJS. It is very basic, and allows you to add tasks, the name of the responsible of the task or tasks and the level of priority.
It is only the user interface, wich it means it doesn´t conect with any data basa, use a json file instead (to emulated the db).
